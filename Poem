This is a poem about the Earth:

The earth is a big round ball.
It is made of dirt and water, and its not very small.
It has mountains and trees.
It's the bees knees.
The Earth is pretty great,
but lets give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate.

Other planets are pretty cool, I guess.
But Earth's still the best.
On the Earth people play chess,
and birds make their nests.
Frogs hopping from pond to pond.

Earth is pretty cool,
It kinda rules.


a tree of large size
known as the babaluck tree
is known for it's fruit

the babaluck fruit
babaluckologists say
"you get the fruit free"

The earth is where we live.

Rain or shine,
Sunrise or sunset,
With the earth I am obsessed.

Sunrise and sunset
on the other side of the Horizon.
 
It spins on and on
As it rotates on and on ,
Lots of things are going on
 
Lots of things are going on  
 
 Snow, Ice, Rain, Rock, Fire, Lava
 All is earth
 Earth is all
