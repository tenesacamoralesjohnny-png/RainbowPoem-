This is a poem about the Earth:

The earth is a big round ball.
It is made of dirt and water, and its not very small.
It has mountains and trees.
It's the bees knees.
The Earth is pretty great,
but lets give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate.

Other planets are pretty cool, I guess.
But Earth's still the best.
On the Earth people play chess,
and birds make their nests.

Earth is pretty cool,
It kinda rules.
 

Rain or shine,
Sunrise or sunset,
With the earth I am obsessed.
 
 
It spins on and on
As it rotates on and on ,
Lots of things are going on
 
Lots of things are going on
